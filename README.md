Groceries shopping can be sometimes be expensive and many users oftenly find it hard to stick to a budget, so Mutro Grocery Budgeting program is just the solution for that by helping them stay within their financial limits when it comes to grocery shopping. It relies on user input for the budget and the details of the grocery items by a simple user menu interaction dashboard. The results would be a summary of the total costs, grocery list and the budget status of the user. It allows users to add, update and remove the items by inputting the name, price and the quantity of each item, in addition users can also set or update a budget and the program will calculate the total costs of the items in the list and if the total cost exceeds the set budget then the user is going to be alerted on the budget status. The output will display all the items in the grocery list, their prices and their respective quantities. The total cost would be shown based on the calculations and it will indicate whether the user is under or over budget. It also would have an option where the user can update his/her budget if needed.
